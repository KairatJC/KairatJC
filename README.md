## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
# My name is Kairat
I feel like Frontend Developer. But also I know about C# Backend, Automation QA stuff, Security Engineering, etc.
  
What makes me a Frontend Developer?

## First, I know what a quality website is.
My criteria for Quality are:
- **Accessibility** - I use Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - recommendations for making Web content more accessible;
- **Security** - The OWASP Top 10 - list of the most critical security risks to web applications.
- **Clear UX** - my personal user experience.

## The second thing is - I know what site is and how to create site from scratch:
